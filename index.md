# Welcome to Android Development

## Kotlin

Please check back regularly, as I will do my best to update these notes througout the term.

The Java Programming language has traditionally been used for Android development. In this course we will be using the Kotlin programming language instead. Many would agree that Kotlin is a more concise language to program in, and in fact tries to improve upon other languages downfalls e.g. the null pointer exception.

Kotlin gained more traction after **Google's announcement that Kotlin is the official language for Android Development**. Kotlin
is a multiple purpose langauge e.g. code can be used to full-stack development, Mobile and front-end development.

Kotlin code can be _converted_ to other source code in Android studio e.g you can convert Kotlin to Java code and vice versa.

Kotlin allows a programming to write code in any of the following paradigms
- OOP
- Functional Programming
- Scripting


Note: to deploy locally use 
 bundle exec jekyll serve

 to post to git normal follow normal process
