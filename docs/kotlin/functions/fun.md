# Functions

Kotlin lets you work with read-only and mutable variables. To make a variable
read only use val and to make a variable writable use var. Kotlin recommends
using **val** over **var** whenever possible. Perhaps, this becomes more important
when performing functional programming.

```
val avogadroNumber:Double = 6.022e23
test
