# Kotlin Overview

The Java Programming language has traditionally been used for Android development. In this course we will be using the Kotlin programming language instead. Many would agree that Kotlin is more concise language to program in, and in fact tries to improve upon other languages downfalls e.g. the null pointer exception found in Java and other C syntax langauges.

Kotlin gained more traction after **Google's announcement that Kotlin is the official language for Android Development**. Kotlin
is a multiple purpose langauge e.g. code can be used in full-stack development, Mobile and front-end development.

Kotlin code is _compiled/converted_ into bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In Android studio e.g you can convert Kotlin to Java code and vice versa.  You can even run Java alongside with Kotlin, however, I don't recommend doing so.

Kotlin allows a developer to write code in any of the following paradigms
- OOP
- Functional Programming
- Procedural
