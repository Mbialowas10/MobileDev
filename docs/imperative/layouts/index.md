![Layouts In Imperative Programming](../mnt/data/image.png)

### Resources:
- LayoutDemo project

### Overview
- Every XML file must have a View or View Group assigned to it.
  - A View is a piece of UI the user sees on the screen.
  - A View Group is invisible but is used to create a structure of the UI layout.

### Compilation
- Each XML file gets compiled into a view, i.e., a piece of UI.

### Layout Types Available:
1. **Linear Layout** – horizontal or vertical placement.
2. **Relative Layout** – relative to another element.
3. **Web View** – display webpage.
4. **Constraint Layout** – like relative layout in a flattened structure.

### List View:
- Displays child items in vertical fashion.

### Linear Layout:
- Displays children in horizontal or vertical fashion.

### Instructions:
- In Android Studio, create a new project (see sample project if you need a guided example) and create two layout files.
  1. Set one as LinearLayout Horizontal.
  2. Set the other as LinearLayout Vertical.
  
- Talk about some attributes and mention `Manifest.xml` file.
