_When to clone or fork a gitHub repo?_

The difference between cloning and forking a repository on GitHub lies in ownership and purpose:

üîÅ Clone
What it does: Copies a GitHub repository to your local machine.

Use case: When you want to inspect, build, or modify a project locally, but don‚Äôt plan to contribute back or don‚Äôt need your own copy on GitHub.

Command:
```kotlin
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
Ownership: You do not own the original repo. You‚Äôre just making a local copy.

üç¥ Fork
What it does: Creates a copy of someone else‚Äôs repo under your own GitHub account.

Use case: When you want to contribute to a project or customize it, and possibly send a pull request to propose changes to the original repo.

How to do it: Click the Fork button on the GitHub repo page.

Ownership: You now have your own version of the repo on GitHub, which you can freely modify and push to.

Typical Workflow:
If you want to contribute to an open-source repo:

1. Fork it (makes a copy on your GitHub).
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Make changes locally.
4. Push changes to your fork.
5. Create a pull request to the original repo.
