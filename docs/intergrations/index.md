## 3rd party integrations ##

Android Development often includes integrating pieces of software (libraries or 3rd party integrations) into an existing project.
In the Android community many 3rd party libraries have been created to solve particular problems. There is 
no need to re-invent the wheel. This allows developers to focus on solving the particular business problem or need.

An analogy to this is that of assembling a car on a production line. Your development team may be responsible for
creating the transmission. Therefore you need to understand how the transmission plugs into the engine and drive-train and sits
ontop of the frame.

In this section, we will explore libraries common to interacting with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), 
client-server clients, Relational and NoSQL Databases, and Authentication clients.
